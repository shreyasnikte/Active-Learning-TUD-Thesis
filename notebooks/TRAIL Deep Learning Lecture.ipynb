    "### Need of Deep learning over Machine learning\n",
    "- Only useful when you dont know what to measure. If you know what to measure, you can have a clear path to possible convergence using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep learning models learn features, machine learning model does not care about features, but care about robust model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Therefore, deep learning models are task specific\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimisation - The deep learning models need more optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current research:\n",
    "    - Reduce annotation efforts (active learning, semi supervised)\n",
    "    - Interpretability\n",
    "    - Efficiency (computational)\n",
    "    - Security against adversarial attacks (wrong predictions)"
